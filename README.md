# :fire: SL2Bonfire - What is it :interrobang:
This app can **unpack and create SL2 archives** from/for various FromSofrware's games. It can also **resign saves** with your own SteamID or patch games memory to **bypass the SaveData ownership checks**. Finally it allows you to **rename your characters**.

# :scream: Is it safe?
**No.** You can corrupt your SaveData files or get banned from playing online if you unreasonably modify your save.  

**First of all:** Always make backups of files you want to modify.

**Secondly,** do not patch game's memory while you're connected to the internet. Playing offline is not enough, you have to **disconnect the network cable or disable the network card on your device**.  
Personally I'm using [Net Disabler](https://www.sordum.org/9660/net-disabler-v1-1/).

**Finally,** just modifying your hero's name shouldn't lock you out from online play, unless you'll pick some offensive, too long or containing special characters (like: !/:?#) name.  
  
You have been warned and now you can move on to the next chapter fully aware.
